            <div class = "Description">Our project sets out to create a cross-platform voice recognition system that would mimic users’ behaviour on a personal computer or smart devices. We got our inspiration from powerful assistants, such as Iron Man’s J.A.R.V.I.S, who could carry out any tasks taught to them.</div>

              <div>We all share the same interest in AI, and Machine Learning and have inspiration from J.A.R.V.I.S from "Iron Man", we started our project. 
            </div>
                <div>One aspect that all group members agreed early in the development process was that the program will be able to record user-submitted macros - a series of recorded actions. This feature will allow users to command the program much more quickly and conveniently.</div>


              </div>
              </div>


              <div class = "Box1_1">
                  <div class = "TnT">2.BASIC COMMANDS</div>
                  <div class = "MT2">With the ideas above, our group started to code our programs.Implementing the voice recognition system and parsing the recorded voice input was not challenging.Executing those voice commands, however, was. The user could very clearly see a button (for example, the minimize window button) and manually click on it. The program could not do this; it could only be instructed to do so by the user. Therefore, we added more functionalities to smoothen the user experience, such as minimizing and maximizing a window, or launching the default web browser.

                    <div class = "TnT">3.TESTING</div>
                    <div class = "MT1">
                    <div>-  We wanted the program to be able to fetch weather data of a city or region and pronounce it to the user, but we decided not to include this feature since we think that it would be inconsistent.Since we could not reliably implement such other features, we abandoned the weather data idea for the sake of consistency</div>
                   <div>- Program would only respond and execute commands when invoked. Only by saying “Tony” before issuing commands could users expect their voice inputs to be executed. We wanted our users to be able to give commands while carrying out conversations, watching videos, or listening to music</div>

                        <div>By week 10, our group has finished coding the most essential parts of the program. The voice recognition program runs smoothly, recognizes commands, and quickly executes them; macros are correctly recorded, named, and replayed. </div>

This program mimics simple user inputs, such as mouse movements and pressing keys, as well as more advanced user demands including sending hotkeys and launching web browsers. </div>
                <div class="HardwareText2" style="color: red">2. Tony also offers to record a series of inputs from users - a macro - that would then be saved and invoked. By allowing users to record and name their own macro, Tony enables quick and convenient customization. Since all of Tony’s actions are carried out on screen, Tony does not suffer from being restricted from websites and applications.</div>

Many more real-life situations would welcome a constantly learning program like Tony, such as lab teachers or cooks searching for recipes.</div>
                <div class = "HardwareText2" style="color:red">- Tony outshines existing voice assistants in many aspects. Tony does not force users to use certain applications, and use the default instead. Tony also allows users to customize their experience, and not limited the the basic commands. Furthermore, our program enables execution of commands across websites and applications, unlike many platform-specific voice assistants.</div>
