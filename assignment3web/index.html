            <div class = "Description">Our project sets out to create a cross-platform voice recognition system that would mimic users’ behaviour on a personal computer or smart devices. We got our inspiration from powerful assistants, such as Iron Man’s J.A.R.V.I.S, who could carry out any tasks taught to them.</div>

              <div>We all share interests in AI - Machine Learning. Drawing inspiration from powerful assistants like J.A.R.V.I.S from "Iron Man", we started our project. 
            </div>
                <div>One aspect that all group members agreed early in the development process was that the program will be able to record user-submitted macros - a series of recorded actions. This feature will allow users to command the program much more quickly and conveniently.</div>

                  <div class = "MT2">The most basic commands include moving the mouse cursor, pressing keys, and combining hotkeys. We added more functionalities to smoothen the user experience, such as minimizing and maximizing a window, or launching the default web browser. Unlike the user, the program could not clearly see a button (for example, the minimize window button) and manually click on it.

                    <div class = "MT1">
                    <div>-  Development of Tony relies heavily on testing sessions. Through testing, we added features such as adjusting system volume.</div>
                   <div>- By testing, we made the decision that the program would only respond and execute commands when invoked, by saying “Tony” before issuing commands, allowing users to carry out conversations, watch videos, or listen to music.</div>

This program mimics simple user inputs, such as mouse movements and pressing keys, as well as more advanced user demands including sending hotkeys and launching web browsers. </div>
                <div class="HardwareText2" style="color: green">2. Tony also offers to record a series of inputs from users - a macro - that would then be saved and invoked. By allowing users to record and name their own macro, Tony enables quick and convenient customization. Since all of Tony’s actions are carried out on screen, Tony does not suffer from being restricted from websites and applications.</div>
                <div class="HardwareText2" style="color: burlywood ">3. Tony supports users who want to either issue voice commands or work silently, further allows users to customize the automation as much as possible.</div>
                <div class="HardwareText2" style="color: green">4. Tony saves your commands to a file, and uses this file to execute what you have taught it. Connect with other Tony users, share your macros, and help other users simplify their experience.</div>

Gym goers would enjoy Tony’s company as they could seamlessly perform tasks – switching songs, lower volume, or any tasks they have taught Tony – at a distance without dropping their equipments. Many more real-life situations would welcome a constantly learning program like Tony, such as lab teachers or cooks searching for recipes.</div>
                <div class = "HardwareText2" style="color:green">- Tony outshines existing voice assistants in many aspects. Tony does not force users to use certain applications, and use the default instead. Tony also allows users to customize their experience, and not limited the the basic commands. Furthermore, our program enables execution of commands across websites and applications, unlike many platform-specific voice assistants.</div>
